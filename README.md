## 🧠 About Me

I build intelligent, scalable systems at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering.  
My work focuses on Machine Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), Data Science, and production-grade application development.

I enjoy designing systems that are not just experimental — but reliable, maintainable, and deployment-ready.
